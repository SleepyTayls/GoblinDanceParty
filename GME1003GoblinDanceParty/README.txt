Goblin Dance Party Read Me File:

Completed all 6 steps that were given.
I figured I should practice committing and pushing after every step I completed.
This resulted in 6 commit/pushes being executed after the initial repository creation.
I'll have 1 more commit/push to make sure this file is in the repository too.

Struggles: Almost put my full name on the github through commit/push...oops!!
